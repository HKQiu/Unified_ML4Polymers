This is the official repository of the paper entitled as __PolyNC: a natural and chemical language model for unified polymer properties prediction__.
This work features a  a revolutionary model to enable rapid and precise prediction of Polymer properties via the power of Natural language and Chemical language (PolyNC). This work extends
the powerful natural language understanding capabilities of AI to the field of polymer research, marking an impressive step towards the development of expert models and human-level AI for
understanding polymer knowledge.

**All data and code** about model training and polyScreen software are in this repository.
